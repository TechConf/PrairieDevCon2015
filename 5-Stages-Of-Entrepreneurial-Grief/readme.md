The 5 Stages of Entrepreneurial Grief
============

This was a talk by Derick Bailey, on the realities of what
entrepreneurial life is like. Beyond the supposed fame and glory,
there is a more difficult reality to contend with. It's a hard
path to travel, but one that is well worth it if you do.

## The Abstract

STARTUPS! ENTREPRENEURSHIP!! INDEPENDENCE!!! YYYEEEEAAAAHHH!!! It's all glory and fame, and a wonderful life the way the media claims, right?! Overnight success !!! ... rags to riches... ??? risking everything and getting it all back, 1000-fold? ... Right?

Sadly, no. The reality of bootstrapping your own products and services and earning the trust of other people to create customers and revenue, is about as far from that lie as you can imagine. It's hard work and stressful. But that doesn't mean it's not worth it. It means you need to be prepared for it.

Through personal stories - from the joy of success to the near desctruction of a company by accidentally deleting the production database with no backup solution in place - Derick Bailey will help you prepare for the often cyclical process of dealing with the 5 stages of entrepreneurial grief: Denial, Anger, Barganing, Depression and Acceptance.

## Watch The Full Presentation

I recorded the entire presentation from my laptop, using a portable
microphone as well. The video turned out great, and you can see
all of the slides, my body language and movement, and hear the
session quite well. Check it out!
